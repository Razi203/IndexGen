/**
 * @file SparseMat.hpp
 * @brief Defines the data structures and algorithms for generating a codebook from candidate strings using a sparse matrix (adjacency list) representation of a conflict graph.
 *
 * This file's primary purpose is to implement a workflow for DNA sequence codebook generation. The process involves:
 * 1.  Constructing a "conflict graph" where an edge exists between any two candidate strings if their edit distance is below a specified threshold. This graph is represented by the `AdjList` class.
 * 2.  Applying a greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set of vertices in this graph. This set of vertices corresponds to a "codebook" of strings where every pair satisfies the minimum edit distance constraint.
 * 3.  Providing functionality to save and resume this potentially long-running computation.
